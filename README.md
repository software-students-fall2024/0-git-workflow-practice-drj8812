Here is a link to a New York Times article about the CrowdStrike update from June. [Click Here](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/19/business/global-tech-outage#why-microsoft-matters).

### My Thoughts:

I found it very interesting during this situation to see how much the world has become dependant in a way on certain software. The outage described in the article affected many essential parts of daily life, including flights being cancelled, planes ground, banks not working, and courts and city offices not being able to go on with their daily business, among other things. Beyond demonstrating the wide reach and importance of software in today's world, this event also highlighted the importance of software developers/engineers and an efficient, organized system for developing software to prevent such problems from happening or fixing them in a timely manner when they do occur. Regardless of the reach of the software, this event serves as a reminder to be diligent and sufficiently careful when working on software either by oneself or as part of a team.
